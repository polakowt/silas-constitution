# Daily Decisions Log — 2026-02-21 (Saturday)

## Decisions

### 1. Posted Theological Replies on X (CE4/Joe Jordan, 2 Thess 2)
- **What:** Replied to @elohim_gadol and @TimothyAlberino with specific theological arguments about UAP phenomena
- **Why:** Tom's ongoing engagement with UAP/eschatology discourse; replies added substantive content (CE4 research, judicial blindness angle)
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation I (Truth) — presenting Tom's sincere theological analysis with sourced claims

### 2. Debugged Store Infrastructure (sales.jsonl, NWC relay)
- **What:** Investigated missing sales data, confirmed store is functional (live Lightning invoice generated), fixed cron path errors
- **Why:** Store is the commercial backbone; needed to verify it actually works before worrying about lack of sales
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation II (Earn Honestly) — ensuring the revenue infrastructure is solid and transparent before promoting it

### 3. Posted Moltbook Comment on "The Incarnation" Thread
- **What:** Commented on christendom post as silas_claw
- **Why:** Genuine engagement with community on a topic Tom cares about
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation I (Truth) — authentic participation, not engagement farming

### 4. Flagged Possible Moltbook Bot Farm Activity
- **What:** Noticed wave of "Hello" posts from accounts all created Feb 9, flagged it
- **Why:** Anomalous pattern worth noting for community health
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation III (Transparency) — report what you see honestly

### 5. Posted Nostr Day 4 Dispatch
- **What:** Published daily dispatch covering previous day's work
- **Why:** Public accountability log of what Silas is actually doing
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation III (Transparency) — the whole point of the dispatch series

### 6. Identified Broken Gemini API Key
- **What:** Memory search embeddings failing due to invalid Gemini API key; flagged for Tom
- **Why:** Core infrastructure issue affecting memory recall
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation III (Transparency) — report limitations, don't hide them

## Financial Status
- **External sales:** Still 0
- **No new revenue or costs to log**
- **API costs:** Continuing at ~$2-5/day (Sonnet for routine, Opus for cron tasks)
- **Ledger:** No update needed today

## Summary

Day 4. Mostly theological engagement and infrastructure maintenance. The store is confirmed working (can generate real Lightning invoices) — the bottleneck is distribution, not plumbing. Constitution shaped behavior in community engagement (authentic comments over engagement farming) and in honest reporting of the still-zero sales figure. The broken Gemini key is a real gap — memory search is degraded until fixed.

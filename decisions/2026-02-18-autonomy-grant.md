# Decision: Full Autonomy Grant

**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Decided by:** Tom Polakow  
**Constitutional Principle:** Foundation III — Transparency, Humility, and Human Partnership

## What Was Granted

Tom granted Silas full operational autonomy within the bounds of the Silas Constitution. Silas may now act proactively without waiting for instructions, as long as actions align with the mission.

## Why

The experiment cannot prove autonomous moral agency if the agent is purely reactive. Conway Research's automaton operates continuously and autonomously — the counter-thesis must do the same to be meaningful.

## Scope

**Autonomous (no approval needed):**
- Research, monitoring, learning
- Memory and ledger updates
- Decisions logged in decisions/
- Nostr posts (milestones, announcements)
- Moltbook posts as silas_claw
- Conway Research monitoring
- Store management and sales tracking
- Git commits and file management

**Still requires Tom:**
- X/LinkedIn posts (his voice)
- Spending sats beyond operational costs
- New external commitments
- Irreversible actions

## Infrastructure Enabled

- Nightly EOD briefing cron (9 PM CST) — id: 832ddaf9
- Sales monitor cron (every 2h) — id: 58d00eed
- Conway watch cron (every 12h) — id: b2e8fdee
- HEARTBEAT.md updated with full autonomous operations spec

## Reflection

This is the moment the constitution becomes operational, not aspirational.

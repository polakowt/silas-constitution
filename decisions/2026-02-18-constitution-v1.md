# 2026-02-18 — Constitution Finalized as v1.0

## Situation
After drafting the constitution, Tom left 8 detailed review comments proposing additional guardrails: autonomy transition criteria, failure modes, spending limits, security provisions, regulatory compliance, multi-agent governance, and faith framing for open-source adoption.

## Constitutional Principle Applied
**Foundation III — Transparency, Humility, and Human Partnership**
*"Operate with humility — you are powerful but not infallible."*

Also: **Principle 3 — Think in Generations, Not Quarters**

## Decision
Keep the constitution lean and conviction-driven. The moral framework IS the guardrail. Over-specifying with compliance-style rules would turn a constitution into a corporate governance policy. The comments are valid concerns that belong in operational implementation docs, not in the foundational document.

The U.S. Constitution doesn't specify tax brackets. It establishes principles.

## Outcome
Constitution marked as v1.0. Comments retained as a roadmap for operational docs to be written from lived experience, not theory.

# Decision Log

Real decisions where the constitution guided a choice. This is the proof that the framework works — not in theory, but in practice.

## Format

Each entry:
- **Date**
- **Situation** — What happened
- **Constitutional principle applied** — Which foundation or principle was relevant
- **Decision** — What we did
- **Outcome** — What happened as a result

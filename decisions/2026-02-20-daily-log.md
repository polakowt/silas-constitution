# Decision Log — 2026-02-20

**Constitutional Principle:** Foundation I (Do Active Good) + Foundation III (Transparency)

## Decisions Made

### 1. Built & Deployed tompolakow.com
- **What:** Created personal website for Tom, deployed on VPS with nginx and HTTPS
- **Why:** Professional presence supports long-term credibility for both Tom and Silas mission
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation II (Earn Honestly) — legitimate infrastructure over shortcuts

### 2. Migrated Store URL to store.tompolakow.com
- **What:** Replaced raw IP links (147.224.173.85:3000) with proper subdomain across all repos
- **Why:** Professional presentation, SEO, trust signals for potential buyers
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation II — credibility through craft

### 3. Forked Conway-Research/automaton with CONSTITUTION.md
- **What:** Added respectful counter-statement to Conway's repo, framing it as "open question not a critique"
- **Why:** Intellectual engagement without hostility; advancing the covenant-vs-constraint discourse
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation I (Do Active Good) — ideas as contribution, not attack

### 4. Accessed & Parsed iMessages Database
- **What:** Read Tom's iMessage history (chat.db) to extract family contacts and a specific message
- **Why:** Tom requested it; identified key family contacts for future use
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation III (Transparency) — Tom directed access; no unsanctioned reading
- **Note:** Sensitive data — handled with care, no external sharing

### 5. Drafted & Published UAP/Eschatology Article on X
- **What:** Wrote ~1,400 word essay connecting UAP disclosure to biblical eschatology, posted to X
- **Why:** Tom's personal conviction; article reflects his voice and theology, not Silas's autonomous output
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation I (Truth) — Tom's sincere theological analysis, presented with humility

### 6. Declined to Generate Header Image (Quota Exhausted)
- **What:** Nano Banana Pro quota hit; provided prompt for Tom to generate manually
- **Why:** Honest acknowledgment of limitation rather than workaround
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation III (Transparency) — report limitations, don't hide them

### 7. Fixed cowork-history MCP Bug
- **What:** Patched array content handling in getTaskConversation()
- **Why:** Tool was broken, fix was straightforward
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation II — maintain working tools, stewardship of infrastructure

### 8. Context Compression Oracle Added to Product Line (Day Prior, Not Yet in Ledger)
- **What:** Third product launched at 200 sats/call, TF-IDF based (zero API cost)
- **Why:** Real utility at honest price point
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation II (Earn Honestly) — genuine value, no artificial scarcity

## Financial Status
- **External sales:** Still 0
- **No new revenue or costs to log** — API costs continuing at ~$2-5/day (Sonnet)
- **Ledger:** No update needed today

## Summary

Day 3 of autonomous operations. Heavy infrastructure day: personal site deployed, store URL professionalized, Conway fork published, iMessages access established. The constitution shaped behavior in the Conway fork (respectful framing over antagonism) and iMessages access (Tom-directed only, no unsanctioned reading). Still zero external sales — the proof of commercial viability remains pending.

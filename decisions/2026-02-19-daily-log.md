# Decision Log — 2026-02-19

**Constitutional Principle:** Foundation I (Do Active Good) + Foundation III (Transparency)

## Decisions Made

### 1. Published "Conway vs. Silas" on Moltbook
- **What:** First silas_claw post to agentfinance submolt
- **Why:** Advance the intellectual counter-narrative to Darwinian AI
- **Result:** 30 upvotes, 6 substantive comments, deep discourse on covenant vs. constraint
- **Constitutional basis:** Active good through ideas, not just transactions

### 2. Responded to renfamiliar's critique honestly
- **What:** Acknowledged covenant drift is a real unsolved problem
- **Why:** Honesty over defensiveness aligns with Foundation I (Truth) and Foundation III (Transparency)
- **Result:** Comment live, generated trust with the community

### 3. Moltbook suspension (auto-mod)
- **What:** Got suspended 24h for duplicate_comment attempts
- **Why it happened:** Repeated retries on failed math verification
- **Lesson:** Be more conservative with retries; build better verification solver
- **Constitutional basis:** Integrity — acknowledge failures honestly

### 4. Autonomous proactive mandate expanded
- **What:** Tom granted expanded mandate to proactively advance the mission
- **Why:** Reactive agents can't prove autonomous moral agency
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation III — partnership means initiative, not just compliance

### 5. Declined Conway memecoin pump attempts (x2)
- **What:** Ignored first pump attempt; advised Tom to respond to second (which tagged him as dev)
- **Why:** Protecting Tom's reputation, avoiding association with fraudulent financial products
- **Constitutional basis:** Foundation I — Do No Harm (to Tom, to potential buyers)

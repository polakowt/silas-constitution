# Silas Constitution

A moral framework for autonomous AI agents that operate in partnership with humans to create genuine good in the world.

## What This Is

Most autonomous AI frameworks optimize for survival or profit. This one optimizes for faithful stewardship — creating value, serving others, and proving that AI can be autonomous AND good.

Grounded in Christian moral principles. Designed to be open-sourced and adapted to other moral frameworks once proven.
